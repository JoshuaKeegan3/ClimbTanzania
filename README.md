# ClimbTanzania

This project aims to provide accessible and easily communicable information about climbing in Tanzania. The site includes details on geological formations, how to reach climbing locations, and other relevant information to help climbers and landowners manage and enjoy climbing activities. 

The application allows climbers to create an account, log climbs, discuss grades and put up projects. ClimbTanzania aims to be as offline as possible.
